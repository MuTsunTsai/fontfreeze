> Freeze variations and features in font.

## Introduction

Modern OpenType fonts support variations and features that allow customizable fonts.
The problem is that not all environments support these mechanisms.
IDEs such as Visual Studio only support choosing font family and font size,
without any options to select variants or toggle features.
FontFreeze is a tool that allows you to create a customized instance of a given font,
so that you may use exactly the font you want in those environments.

- Purely front-end, no uploading delay for large font files.
- Instantly preview results in your browser.
- Exports to TTF or WOFF2 formats.
- Supports freezing ligature features.
- Supports most legacy fonts.

## How to use it

Simply visit https://mutsuntsai.github.io/fontfreeze to launch the app, no installation required!

As you open a .ttf file, it will show you the font info and the available options.
You can then select a particular variant (for variable fonts) by selecting one of the predefined instances,
or customize each variable axis.
You can also select features you want to activate (or deactivate) from the feature list:

- For the meaning of each feature, look up the user manual of your font.
  In most cases, the feature you are looking for will be among `cv01`-`cv99`, `ss01`-`ss20`, `zero`, `onum`, etc.\
  (Hover your mouse over the a tag name to display a link to the corresponding documentation in the Microsoft Typography website.)
- Most coding fonts have their coding ligatures defined in the `calt` feature.
  If you want to completely disable ligatures,
  deactivating `calt` will usually do the trick.
- Leaving a feature blank means keeping its default behavior
  (which may or may not be activated depending on the environment).
- There are two modes of subsetting: remove certain glyphs from the font
  (useful when you want those characters to fallback to other fonts),
  or keep only certain glyphs (useful when you only need a few characters for your website, for example).

Finally, click `Generate font!` to generate your font.
It's that simple!

Tips:

- Whenever possible, use a non-variable version of the font as starting point,
  as it will likely give better hinting than the variable one.
- The preview text is editable.
  You can put any sample source code in it to preview the result.
- If you have multiple screens with different DPIs,
  preview on each of them to make sure the result is perfect.
- To work with [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts),
  make sure that you freeze the font first, and then patch it.
  Do it the other way could lead to error (see [#8](https://github.com/MuTsunTsai/fontfreeze/issues/8#event-9248246359)).

## How it works

FontFreeze uses [fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools),
a Python library for manipulating fonts.
In then utilizes [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)
to run Python code directly in your browser through WebAssembly,
so it's purely front-end and nothing is stored in the back-end.
The UI part is built with [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

The way FontFreeze deactivates a feature is by removing all lookups inside it,
and it activates a feature by moving all lookups in it into `calt`,
which is usually activated by default in most environments.
If this doesn't work for a particular environment,
you may also try changing the "Target feature for activation" setting to `rvrn`
(which is more forced than `calt` by the OpenType specification;
note that in this case,
you might also need to activate `calt` as well for some other features to function).

Since version 1.3, in addition to the said approach,
there is also an option to apply actual glyph substitution for single-glyph features
(which is on by default) for maximal compatibility across different environments.

## Acknowledgment

FontFreeze is especially inspired by the project
[vfit](https://github.com/jonpalmisc/vfit),
and I used many parts of the source code from it.
Other projects that inspired FontFreeze include:

- [OpenType Feature Freezer](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer),
  for inspiring the name (I used additional approach to freeze the features though).
- [FontDrop!](https://fontdrop.info/), for inspiring the user interface.
- [Coding Fonts](https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/coding-fonts)
  (the original site no longer works,
  but [here](https://coding-fonts.netlify.app/) is a clone of it),
  for inspiring the default preview text.
- [Microsoft Typography](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography),
  for maintaining a detailed documentation on the OpenType specs.
- [Font Squirrel Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator),
  for **NOT** working on any of the fonts I wanted to pass to it,
  and forcing me to create my own tool.
